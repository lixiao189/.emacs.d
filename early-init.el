;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)
;; Disable package.el initialization; straight.el will bootstrap itself.
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
